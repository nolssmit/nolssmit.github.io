The first part of the route traverses the Black Reef Quartzite Formation, the base of the Transvaal Supergroup. A few kilometers before Kaapschehoop, you get a turnoff to the right, which leads to Geosite 1  on this route, which is known as the Kaapsehoop lookout point.\n\nAt this site, you can look out, via  a spectacular viewpoint over the Lowveld, consisting of Basement granite, towards Swaziland, which is now known as Eswatini  and the Barberton Greenstone Belt, part of the ancient continental crust, which consists of rocks up to 3.8 billion years old. Turn back to Kaapschehoop and continue along the road to Nelspruit, now known as Mbombela. \n\nAt Kaapchehoop is the site of a gold discovery, which was made in 1882 and is known as Duiwels Kantoor, an area consisting of pillars of Black Reef Quartzite, which gave rise to the name of this site. The gold was discovered in a small creek and led to a local gold rush. Beyond Kaapsche Hoop you now enter the Basement granite-gneiss terrane of the Lowveld."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30.778584,-25.592379]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"site_type_id":"0195fbc0-f918-7503-ba3f-3e28533cea3e","sitename":"Mbombela Botanical Garden","description":"In Mbombela is the Lowveld Botanial Garden (Geosite 2), located near the intersection of the R37 and the R40.

This is Geosite 4 of this route. Stromatolites are enormous algal domes and are visible as mega-domes and were formed by algal colonies that deposited the carbonate that gave rise to the Malmani Dolomites, along which the road travels and which form the mountainous area. The algae lived in shallow water of the ancient inland sea of the Kaapvaal craton, 2 600 to 2 400 million years ago. These algal colonies lived in water less than about 100 meters deep. Interesting to note is that these early algae was partly responsible for providing the Earth’s first oxygen, without which humans, animals and other life forms would not have been able to inhabit the planet.
